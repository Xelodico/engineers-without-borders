**Entry for the Engineers Without Borders UK *Engineering for People Design Challenge* 2024/25**

This game is a turn-based multiplayer board game designed to tackle the real-world issue of potholes in Makers Valley, South Africa.

By combining strategic gameplay with educational elements, the game encourages players to think critically about resource management, community impact, and sustainable solutions.

Developed by a team of second year Computer Science students, this project showcases practical software engineering skills while addressing a genuine social and environmental problem.

## üí° Features

- **Local Multiplayer Gameplay**: Up to four players compete to repair potholes on a 10x10 grid.
- **Resource Management**: Players collect and use limited resources to fix potholes of varying sizes.
- **Educational Focus**: Teaches players about pothole repair, sustainability, and community involvement through interactive learning.
- **Easy Setup**: Developed entirely in Java with no external dependencies.

## üìö Documentation

### **[Poster](https://nbviewer.org/github/Xelodico/random-resources/blob/main/documents/Engineers%20Without%20Borders/A1Poster.pdf)**

Here, we propose training residents to use cold asphalt, supported by an app for reporting and managing repairs, reducing environmental impact and empowering locals to improve road safety.

### **[PDF Report 1](https://nbviewer.org/github/Xelodico/random-resources/blob/main/documents/Engineers%20Without%20Borders/PDF%20Report%201.pdf)**

This document contains our team‚Äôs Semester 1 deliverables, including:

- A detailed problem statement and proposed solution to road infrastructure issues in Maker‚Äôs Valley
- A gamified board game concept to raise awareness and simulate pothole repair strategies
- Use case descriptions, UML use case and class diagrams, and sequence diagrams outlining game logic
- A draft game board layout developed in Java Swing
- Personal statements from team members
- Full team meeting minutes documenting weekly progress and planning

It serves as a comprehensive record of our research, design process, and planning during the first half of the project..

### **[PDF Report 2](https://nbviewer.org/github/Xelodico/random-resources/blob/main/documents/Engineers%20Without%20Borders/PDF%20Report%202.pdf)**

This document presents the second half of the project, covering:

- Team contributions and personal statements
- Finalised game implementation in Java (UI, game logic, and task system)
- UML class diagram, final game board layout, and design documentation
- Acceptance test plan and GUI survey results
- Weekly meeting minutes detailing development progress
- GitLab and JUnit test evidence
- Security and assurance considerations
- Comments on design choices and rejected development options

It reflects the complete development, testing, and refinement of the board game solution.
